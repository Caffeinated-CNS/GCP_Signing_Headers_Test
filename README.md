# GCP_Signing_Headers_Test
App to generate GCP Cloud Storage (GCS) signed URLs with extra headers to see if any will make it to the GCS logs for correlation (i.e., signed URL link to GCS log tracing) &amp; tracking (e.g., to limit the usable period of signing key to a single download / minimal time period).
